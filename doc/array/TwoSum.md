# Two Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
add up to a specific target.

## Example
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

## Assumption / Constraints
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
not use the same element twice.

## Input Format
The first line contains two integers - first is size of the array and second
is target element. The second line contains integer array elements separated
by space

## Output Format
The output contains two indices of the two numbers that add up to target
separated by space

## Sample Input
```
4 9
2 7 11 15
```
## Sample Output
```
0 1
