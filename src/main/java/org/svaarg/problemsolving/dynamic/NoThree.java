Problem Statement
-----------------
Given is a sequence of distinct positive numbers, Ô¨Ånd a sub-sequence with the
maximum possible sum, with the restriction that it is not allowed to take three
consecutive elements from the original sequence.

For example, for input sequence {1, 6, 5, 2, 7, 9, 3, 4}, the sub-sequence with
the maximum possible sum is {6, 5, 7, 9, 4} (here two pairs of consecutive
elements are {6, 5} and {7, 9} but not three consecutive elements).

Give an O(n) dynamic programming solution to find the sum of such sub-sequence
(assume input sequence of length n). Provide heart of the solution.

Input Format
------------
The first line contains n, and it is followed by a line containing n values,
each separated by a white space. Assume that n is less than 1000 and that all
input values fit in a 32 bit integer.

Output Format
-------------
The output contains a single line containing a single number, the maximum sum
of elements of the sequence satisfying the constraint that no three consecutive
elements are included. Include the new-line character in your output line.

Sample Input 1:
5
3 4 5 1 2

Sample Output 1:
11
